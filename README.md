Track-trace is trucking location app that allows you to update your current location in just one click and share it through Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare. Your location is also automatically posted to the Truckily map so that customers can look for trucks in their area and find out where you and others are serving for the day. We also love that this app allows you to schedule your locations ahead of time (for those days when you know food,icecream,coffee will be flying out the window as soon as you’ve shut off the ignition) and that it sends push notifications to fans who want to be alerted when you’re nearby.
